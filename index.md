## A note about the security implications

This is an open source project using TravisCI to create the build.  All modules used in this project, with the exception of Astroneer itself, are open source and available on their respective repositories.  The security warning is because the EXE generated is not signed, but can be ignored as all the code leading up to that EXE is available for your review.
